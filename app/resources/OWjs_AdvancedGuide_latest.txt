[[ CHAPTER 1 - GETTING STARTED ]]

-INTRODUCTION-

Hello,

This readme is meant to serve as an advanced guide in order to assist in the usage of the Openweb.js application.
Below you will find an easy to follow guide in order to get up and running quickly with the platform. The sections 
below are delinated by a numerical system, with sub-sections outlined in alpha-characters.



-PERSISTENT COORD SYSTEM SYNCHING-

One of the key features of the OpenWeb application is the coordinate synching system, which allows for persistance of
map states throughout browser refresh cycles. The synching system also allows for convenient bookmarking of map locals.

The two main coordinates that are synched in OpenWeb are the State Plane coordinate system (default), and Lat/Long.
The coordinate system type used throughout the application can be changed with the Coord System dropdown, located in the
"Information Block" in the lower left quadrant of the left-most side panel.

An outline of the synching system can be found below:

[State Plane (Default)]
gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?@781994,26761960,6 (where the first 2 numerical values delineate state plane coords, and the final
integer is the level of detail)

[Lat/Lon]
gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?@36.1645079,-115.1570102,6 (where the first 2 numerical values delineate lat/lon coords, and the final
integer is the level of detail)






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[[ CHAPTER 2 - INTEGRATION ]]

-LINKS-

The OpenWeb application can be referenced via the follow URL:

# Default URL:
gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow



-QUERYSTRING PARAMETERS-

The OpenWeb application can be integrated and referenced by any number of applications for a variety of means.
One way to reference the application is by QueryString Parameters. QS Parameters are helpful because they allow an easy
means of access, or shortcut reference point to a specific location or point on the map residing from within OpenWeb.

The following will outline a few use common cases

(1) A local real-estate agency may have a custom developed application or website used by either/or/both internal staff, 
clientele, or contractor personnel; interfacing with the OpenWeb application by way of a querystring parameter helps
take advantage of some of the customized toolsets, currated data, imagery, and public information required throughout
a typical workflow that might not make sense to develop in-house. In this case, OpenWeb serves as an extension of 
the application. 

a. User accesses the referencing application by clicking a property or point on the map


b. The referencing application take the property of the map, and then passes it on to OpenWeb using an embedded link
Accepted Parameters include:

      //Parcel (APN): ?@13933710002
      //Address: ?@500 Grand Central
      //State Plane Ft: ?@782826,26762144,5
      //Lat/Long: ?@35.8378134,-115.6509992


c. The completed constructed embed link on the referencing application would then take the following format:

[template format]
gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?@{APN}

OR constructed:

gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?@13933710002


d. A zoom level can also be specified for State Plane Ft, as well as Lat/Long parameters.

[template format]
782699,26761532,{ZOOM_LEVEL}

OR constructed:

gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?@782826,26762144,5



-QUERYSTRING PARAMETERS - STATE-BASED PARMS-

The OpenWeb application can further be customized by additional querystring parameters that change the specific
view that is desired for the end-used. Examples of these view customizations are highlighted below:

      //Map View: view=clark county zoning
      //Legend: legend=t/f
      //Weather: weather=t/f
      //Active Tab: tab=display
      //Full Map: fullmap=t/f

      //Examples of usage
      //http://gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow?tab=resources
      //http://gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow?legend=t/
      //http://gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow?owner
      //http://gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?fullmap=t

      //Chaining
      //http://gisgate.co.clark.nv.us/ow/?@=1525 Pinto&view=clark county zoning&legend=t&tab=display&fullmap=t



-CLIENT-SIDE EMBED-

You may also embed the OpenWeb application client-side, internal to your application or website. In the side-panel:

 
a. Navigate to the "Resources" section (denoted by the gear icon)

b. Select the "Share or Embed map" link

c. Select the "Embed" tab

d. Copy and paste the embedded iframe text string, internal to your applications code, where appropriate






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[[ CHAPTER 3 - HOTKEYS ]]

-SHORTCUTS-

The OpenWeb application also allows for an easy means of navigation and operation by way of hotkeys.

At the present time, these are limit to basic functions related to menu and map navigation, but these uses
will be expanded in the future

[hotkeys]
Esc: Used for closing active windows
Arrow Keys: Used for nagivating map
Enter: Used for executing a search
